# exploit_grabber

This tool is very simplistic. All it does is go to the cvetrends website, pull the list of vulnerabilities that are showing up on twitter as actively being talked about by hackers, and gets a list of github links that are on the site.

From there, it checks to see if you have an file called "vuln database.db". If it sees one, it will insert all of the github links it sees into the database file. If it doesn't see one, it will create a new database file and do the same thing.

Finally, it will git clone all of the github links to your hard-drive. It will create the github username folder first (in case you have multiple vulns contributed by one person), then it will clone the actual vuln data.

To install the dependencies:

```pip install requests```

```pip install json```

```pip install sqlite3```
